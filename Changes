1.0.4: Tue May 27 12:12:28 EDT 2008
   - (wow, use version has to be on the same line as our $VERSION
      for older EUMM)

1.0.3: Mon May 26 15:46:29 EDT 2008
   - I might as well do a new version of everything using
     version.pm while I wait for all my CPAN deletes to go
     through.  I just discovered that version.pm doesn't/didn't
     go core until perl 5.9...  I really wish I'd have prereqed
     it everywhere I used it, but I didn't.  *sigh*

1.0.1: Sat May 24 09:45:24 EDT 2008
   - using version.pm as suggested by Andreas Koenig

1.0.1:  Fri Aug 18 16:21:57 EDT 2006
   - I've been told by two respectable coders that my standard
     old GPL+comments license is silly.  It is.  I'm switching to
     the LGPL.  :(

1.0.0:  Fri Aug 18 16:21:57 EDT 2006
   - I got this working
